My First StackEdit Experience
====
 The learning point of this page is try to use StackEdit to edit my TIL blog post and ten to post it to github Huayinthon TIL post.

Among other things, below are the milestones that I want to achieve:   
> - Learn to open two tabs with two different files at the same time with StackEdits 
> - Learn to save StackEdits files. 
> - Get the text I have created here in StackEdit posted to Github Huayinthon.

>Milestone 1.
Learn to open two tabs

I Couldn't open two distinctive StackEdit windows (or tabs) at the same time. All opened StackEdit windows (or tabs ) seem to be synced automatically, and thus are showing the same file. 

There is function called "toggle between documents," which allow us to toggle between documents by pressing "ctr + [ " or "ctr+]." This might be close to what my want, but not quite!

>Learn to save StackEdits file. 

I have managed to save my StackEdit files by clicking "synchronise" and then clicking "save to my google doc."

Another thing worthing mentioning is that StackEdit offers an new features to allow us to sync and save our file with  "CouchDB."  I have attempted to understand how to install and use CouchDB, but all these Github-Styled layout and coding things makes it appear to be otherworldly to me, as I am just a stray new comer in the Github world. I will just save it for later. 

>Milestone 3. 
>Get the text I have created here in StackEdit posted to Github Huayinthon. 

There seems to be numerous ways to get what I have edited here in StackEdit to be posted to Github Huayinthon. For one, I can just copy and paste it. For sure we are above doing it that way.

To use publish function to get it published to straightaway to Github Repository seems to be the way for people admiring automation and app integration. 

If you can see me now on Github Huayinthong repository, it means I have managed to make it published to where you see it now. Otherwise this article will just be lost along with many other files without being made public.
